Neural Network, different layers, input and output.
They are connected to each other with different weights(how strongly connected they are to each other),
BIAS, weighted sum, tanh activation function. to figure out weights and bias we use an algorithom NEAT,
evolution based. It creates population then ranking them with a fitness score, picks the best performing ai's
they breads them together and mutates them to create a new population. evenutally the weights and connections
between the neurons will become more refined simular to how our neurons function.
